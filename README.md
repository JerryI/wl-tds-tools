## Installation 
### Option 1
Install locally using [LPM](https://github.com/JerryI/wl-localpackages)

```mathematica
PacletRepositories[{
    Github -> "https://github.com/JerryI/wl-tds-tools" -> "master"
}]
```

### Option 2
Clone this repository into your project folder and run:
```mathematica
    PacletDirectoryLoad["wl-tds-tools"]
```

## Library Interface 

We separate the toolbox into 3 contexts:

- ``JerryI`TDSTools`Trace` `` : operates with raw time-traces.
- `` JerryI`TDSTools`Transmission` `` : constructs transmission objects from sample and reference time-traces.
- `` JerryI`TDSTools`Material` `` : extracts material parameters from transmission objects.

#### Notes on GPU Acceleration
Test were performed on Mac Air M1 (2021), where 4 cores are used for CPU calculations

- single spectrum wall-time
```
GPU: 0.01 sec
CPU: 0.46 sec
```

- 286 spectra wall-time
```
GPU: 6.05 sec
CPU: 148.3 sec
```

- 1071 spectra wall-time
```
GPU: 22.1 sec
CPU: 550.3 sec
```

The peformance can still be improved by moving more calculations on GPU side. It is in TODO list. 

### Time-traces ‚§µÔ∏è
To construct a time-trace object from a table, use:

#### TDTrace
```mathematica
TDTrace[q_QuantityArray] _TDTrace
```

![](./imgs/trace.png)

This accepts a `QuantityArray`. The units for the time-step must be provided. For example

```mathematica
tds = {
    {3010.1, 0.1},
    {3011.2, 0.2},
    ...
};

tds = TDTrace[QuantityArray[tds, {"Picoseconds", 1}]]
```

#### Properties
Any property can be accessed as a down-value

```mathematica
tds["Properties"]
```

Here is a list
- `"Properties"` : lists all available keys
- `"Spectrum"` : return `QuantityArray` with a complex amplitude spectrum (automatically resampled in a case of jitter issues). *Read-only*
- `"PowerSpectrum"` : returns `QuantityArray` of power spectrum. *Read-only*
- `"Trace"` : return `QuantityArray` of the original time-trace. *Read-only*
- `"FDCI"` : a range of frequency-domain confidence interval. It is generated according to the powerspectrum and provides a coarse estimation of the working range in wavenumbers. This interval will be used later for optimizing material parameters. *Read-only*

### Reconstructing transmission function ‚§µÔ∏è
On the next step we can derive an initial information about the transmission based on the sample and reference time-traces

#### TransmissionObject
A constructor
```mathematica
TransmissionObject[sam_TDTrace, ref_TDTrace, "Thickness"->_Quantity, opts___] _TransmissionObject
```

![](./imgs/tobject.png)

it creates a special object, calculates fourier images, fixes possible jitter issues and estimates the transmission function, i.e.

$$
\hat{t} = \frac{E_{sam}(\omega)}{E_{ref}(\omega)}
$$

#### Options
One can provide the following `opts` to the constructor
- `"Thickness"` : mandatory field. Must be `_Quantity`
- `"Gain"` : a scaling factor for the amplitude of `sam`. By the default is `1.0`
- `"PhaseShift"` : a constant offset in a multiples of `2Pi` to the whole phase of the transmission function. Must be `_Integer`. By the default is `0`.


#### Properties
- `"Properties"` : lists all keys
- `"Thickness"` : returns `Quantity` object with a thickness of the material
- `"\[Delta]t"` : returns estimated time-delay between the sample and the reference signals. *Read-only*
- `"Gain"` : returns a multiplier for `sam` signal
- `"PhaseShift"` : returns a constanst offset of the phase in multples of `2Pi`
---
- `"Frequencies"` : returns `QuantityArray` of the whole range of frequencies. *Read-only*
- `"Transmission"` : returns the power transmission `QuantityArray`, i.e. array of $|\hat{t}(\omega)|^2$. *Read-only*
- `"Phase"` : returns the argument of $\hat{t}$ sampled as a function of frequency in a form of `QuantityArray`. After the creation is wrapped and cannot be used before unwrapping process (see later). *Read-only*
---
- `"Domain"` : returns the ranges of frequencies. *Read-only*
- `"FDCI"` : a range of frequency-domain confidence interval. It is generated according to the powerspectrum and provides a coarse estimation of the working range in wavenumbers. This interval will be used later for optimizing material parameters. *Read-only*
- `"FDCI2"` : it serves the same purpose as `FDCI` (as a criteria parameter), but relies on the phase information. It cannot be with a wrapped phase. *Read-only*

#### How to update transmisstion object
One can update properties of an object without recreating it fully using `Append`

```mathematica
new = Append[tr, "Thickness"->Quantity[1.2, "Millimeters"]]
```

or multiple properties
```mathematica
new = Append[tr, {"Thickness"->Quantity[1.2, "Millimeters"], "Gain"->0.9}]
```

It returns a new object, while the raw data is shared between them internally.

#### Phase unwrapping 
A key challenge in digital signal processing is managing the phase of the signal. To address this, phase unwrapping is employed, which transforms a discontinuous phase signal into a continuous one

```mathematica
TransmissionUnwrap[t_TransmissionObject, type_String, opts___] _TransmissionObject
```

it performs phase-unwrapping procedure on `t` object and returns a new `TransmissionObject` with a modified phase. There is only one sheme specified by `type` for unwrapping is available for now 

- `"Basic"` : uses informed phase unwrapping based on a time-delay between the sample and the reference signals

#### Options
- `"PhaseThreshold"` : sets the treshold for a detector to remove `2Pi` jump. By the default is `5.6`
- `"PhaseShift"` : overrides a constant phase offset parameter to be used later in material parameters extraction


### Material Parameters ‚§µÔ∏è
This the main goal of all optical spectroscopy: use EM waves to probe the responce function of the material to extract all useful properties. Here we focus on $n$ and $\kappa$ (or their derivatives).

#### MaterialParameters 
A constructor and executor
```mathematica
MaterialParameters[t_TransmissionObject, opts___] _MaterialParameters
```
return `MaterialParameters` object, which contains all information about `n`, `k`, `\[Alpha]` (absorption coefficient). Depending on provided options it can use different methods to extract them

![](./imgs/tmat.png)

It can also accept a list with multiple transmission objects and process them as a batch

```mathematica
MaterialParameters[{t__TransmissionObject}, opts___] _List
```

#### Options
- `"Target"` : specifies the target device to be used `"CPU"` or `"GPU"` (OpenCL). By the default is `"CPU"`
- `"SolveNKEquations"` : enables high-persicision $n$ and $\kappa$ extraction (by solving iteratively equations compling them with transmission and phase). The default value is `True`.
- `"NKCycles"` : number of interations for solving nk-equations. The default is `30`.
- `"MovingAverageFilter"` : enables moving average filter (kernel is 2). By the default is `True`.
- `"FabryPerotCancellation"` : enables deconvolution procedure asumming a normal incidence and a perfect slab-like sample. By the default is `True`. DOI: 10.1117/12.612946 
- `"FabryPerotCycles"` : number of iterations for deconvolution procedure. The default is `8`.

#### Notes on GPU target
It uses OpenCL API to work with GPU devices and picks up the fastest available. If the device does not support OpenCL (or problems with drivers), library will fall back to CPU target.

#### Properties
All properties are *read-only*.
- `"Domain"` : frequency range. 
---
- `"Frequencies"` : returns `QuantityArray` of frequencies
- `"Transmission"` : returns `QuantityArray` of a power transmission. If `FabryPerotCancellation` is applied, it will return deconvoluted spectrum. 
- `"Best Transmission"` : returns `"Transmission"` selected in the region of `"FDCI"`
- `"Phase"` : returns `QuantityArray` of the phase of the transmissino function. 
- `"Best Phase"` : returns `"Phase"` selected in the region of `"FDCI"`
---
- `"\[Alpha]"` : returns `QuantityArray` of extracted absorption coefficient.
- `"Raw \[Alpha]"` : returns `"\[Alpha]"` without FP cancellation applied.
- `"n"` : returns extracted real part of refractive index as `QuantityArray`.
- `"k"` : returns extracted imaginary part of refractive index as `QuantityArray`.
- `"Raw k"` : returns `"k"` without FP cancellation applied.
- `"Best \[Alpha]"` : returns `"\[Alpha]"` in the region of `"FDCI"`.
- `"Best Raw \[Alpha]"` : returns `"\[Alpha]"` without FP cancellation applied in the region of `"FDCI"`.
- `"Best n"` : returns `"n"` in the region of `"FDCI"`.
- `"Best k"` : returns `"k"` in the region of `"FDCI"`.
- `"Best Raw k"` : returns `"k"` without FP cancellation applied in the region of `"FDCI"`.
---
- `"Thickness"` : returns the thickness of the material
- `"Gain"` : returns gain of the sample signal (or an amplitude transmission function).
- `"PhaseShift"` : returns a constanst offset of the phase in multples of `2Pi`
---
- `"FDCI"` : a range of frequency-domain confidence interval. It is generated according to the powerspectrum and provides a coarse estimation of the working range in wavenumbers. This interval will be used later for optimizing material parameters. 
- `"FDCI2"` : it serves the same purpose as `FDCI` (as a criteria parameter), but relies on the phase information. It cannot be with a wrapped phase. 
- `"FPReduction"` : a quality factor of Fabry-Perot fringes reduction. `1.0` or close to it means the deconvolution procedure was not succesfull. The higher - the better.

#### Optimizing parameters
The main issue is inaccuracy in `"Thickness"` and `"Gain"`, which comes naturally in a measurements. In this case a slight misaligment can make your results look much worse, when `FabryPerotCancellation` is enabled.

In order to fix this, one can vary those parameters in a fixed range and plot a contour map of `FPReduction` factor. For example

```mathematica
...
tr = TransmissionObject[...];
utr = TransmissionUnwrap[tr, "Basic"];

(* vary thickness and gain *)
map = Table[With[{
  t = Append[utr, {
    "PhaseShift"->1, 
    "Gain"->gain, 
    "Thickness"->Quantity[thickness, "Millimeters"]
    }]
},
  {thickness, gain, t}
], {thickness, 0.4-(15 0.01), 0.4+(15 0.01), 0.01}, {gain, 0.6, 1.2, 0.1}];

map = Flatten[map,1];

(* extract nk and estimate FPReduction *)
map[[All,3]] = #["FPReduction"] &/@ MaterialParameters[map[[All,3]]];

ListContourPlot[map, PlotLegends->Automatic]

(* find the best parmaeters *)
MaximalBy[map, Last]
```

as a result you will see a streched spot on the contour plot, which corresponds (probably) to the best pair

The processed data will look like

![](./imgs/deconv.png)

#### Bath processing (GPU only) ü™à
If you vary the parameters of the same `TransmissionObject` to avoid extra transactions to GPU, one can use provide the set as a list to `MaterialParameters` contructor

```mathematica
MaterialParameters[map[[All,3]], "Target"->"GPU"]
```

this function will group them by `Phase` arrays (comparison by the internal reference will be used, no actual evaluation) and then feed to GPU with shared initial data.

This also takes advantage of non-blocking execution model of OpenCL and loads all data at once.
